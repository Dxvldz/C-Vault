13 keys Encryptor/Decryptor 

We built a shift based encryptor/decryptor. A shift based encryptor is when you can encrypt your text by a certain amount of rotations meaning that if you want your text rotated by 1 A become B, by 2 A becomes C,etc.

Our website currently has 13 keys (1-13) that each provide a different number of rotations.

We built this because we are interested in cybersecurity and we find that encryption is at the center of cybersecurity and privacy.

To build this website we used HTML, to style it we used CSS and for our program we used JavaScript.

It took us a while to come up with this idea but we ended up picking a shift based encryptor because of ROT13. ROT13 was a shift based encryption method that was very popular when the internet was a new thing, people used it to encrypt posts to reach specific audiences (compsci people).
